# Bot Battlr

**Bot Battlr** is a React-based web application where users can view a collection of bots and build their own bot army. The app interacts with a backend API to fetch bot data and allows users to enlist, release, and discharge bots dynamically.

---

## Features

1. **Bot Collection**: Displays a list of all available bots fetched from the backend API.
2. **Your Bot Army**: Allows users to enlist bots from the collection and manage their army.
3. **Enlist Bots**: Add a bot to the user's army (no duplicates allowed).
4. **Release Bots**: Remove a bot from the user's army.
5. **Discharge Bots**: Permanently remove a bot from both the user's army and the backend.
6. **Error Handling**: Displays error messages if API requests fail.
7. **Retry Mechanism**: Automatically retries fetching data after 5 seconds if an error occurs during initial load.
8. **Loading State**: Displays a loading message while fetching data.

2. Implement sorting options (e.g., by name, type, or rarity).
3. Enhance UI/UX with animations and transitions.
4. Add tests for components and API interactions.
